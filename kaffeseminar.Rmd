The publication is no longer the unit of scientific output

Datasets are the valued and scientists are rewarded for data creation

Studies are designed to fill gaps in the evidence 

"Robots" gather data, critically appraise it and report synthesis to scientists

Synthesis is dynamically updated as new evidence becomes available

# What is evidence synthesis?

"‘Evidence synthesis’ refers to the process of bringing together information from a range of sources and disciplines to inform debates and decisions on specific issues. Decision-making and public debate are best served if policymakers have access to the best current evidence on an issue. An accurate, concise and unbiased synthesis of the evidence is therefore one of the most valuable contributions the research community can offer policymakers." (Royal Society)

# Glossary of terms
## Systematic review 
- Methodological approach designed to reduce bias in reviews of literature around a narrow question 
- Not just a review done systematically

## Systematic map
- Essentially a broader systematic review 
- It shows where there are data gaps and data gluts

## Meta-analysis
- Statistical model to bring together effect size estimates from a number of descrete studies
- Yes, it is "just regression"

---
# Glossary continued

## Decision model
- Any model that contextualises the evidence in a form designed to help inform decisions

## Effect size
- The size of the effect of the thing (intervention) that you are interested in (X has a 23% reduction in mortality compared to Y)
- Smaller effects need bigger sample sizes to show a difference

# QPRs, publication bias, etc.

## Challenges
Biases arise in the process of publication for multiple reasons. Publication bias and selective reporting are probably the biggest challenge for ecological evidence synthesis. 

## Opportunities

- Pre-registration
- Open science (sharing data and code)
- Rethink the "tell a good story" narrative when training students

---

# Huge numbers of papers

## Challenges 
Over 2.5 million academic papers published per year

# Opportunities
- Research weaving
- Collaborative synthesis
- Living systematic reviews
- "Robot" data extraction

## "Robot" data extraction

- Data extraction using NLP 
- It's a bit easier in medicine and other sciences with well defined reporting standards
- Although we (Eliza Grimes; Neal Haddaway; Gabby Palomo-Munoz; Me) have started to do this for ecological journals

# Over-reliance on experts alone

# Challenges 
- "Data" & "opinion" easily mixed up in policy 
- Wasted opportunities to fill the knowledge gaps

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_url("https://www.conservationevidence.com/actions/604", height = "400px")

```

# Opportunities
- Primary Research targeted to gaps in our knowledge (Grainger et al. Nat Ecol Evol 4, 495–497 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-020-1141-6)

---
# Critical appraisal subjective & complex
# Challenges
- 

Network meta-analysis and threshold analysis
